# Monkees Website

The Monkees music website is a user centric frontend development project. It provides a band introduction, four songs 
and a music video, a gallery, and a form page for booking the band for events. The website is responsive so that it can be 
viewed on mobile and tablet. 

## Contents

1. index.html - band intro and band member photos
2. music.html - band's songs and music video
3. gallery.html - various band photos
4. bookings.html - provides form for booking events

## Functionality

The functionality of the website allows user to navigate using the nav bar.
The booking.html page includes a Bootstrap form that allows users to input their
private information so that a staff member can contact them about when they want the band booked.

## Deployment

1. I set up Github Desktop on my account.
2. I published my site from the master branch by 
going to my repository and going into "Settings". I clicked master
as my source and saved it. 
3. My site is now published at https://ainedoyle.github.io/firstmilestone/
